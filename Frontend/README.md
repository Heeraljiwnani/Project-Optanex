**Smart Vision Starts Here**  

OptaNex is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** for **smart and accessible eye care**.  
It enables early detection of eye conditions, provides essential screening tools, and helps users manage their eye health over time — all while ensuring **AI support, privacy, and compliance**.  

---

##  Problem Statement
Timely screening and management of eye diseases such as **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** and **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** remain a challenge, especially in **low-access areas**.  
Existing tools are fragmented, lack AI support, and don’t provide personalized care. OptaNex solves this by offering a **unified, accessible, and intelligent eye health solution**.  

---

##  Features
